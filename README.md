## The story behind Labman

I first met Karim and Roland during [Fab9](http://www.fab9jp.com/), they run a very successful space in Austria with many members. During the conference they presented a project they wanted to make. A device to manage Fab Lab members and machines based on RFID tags. During one of these nights with many beers they told me the project would be open source. I was very interested in that and for some time I was in contact with them trying to get more info about the progress.

During [Fab12 in Shenzhen](http://fab12.fabevent.org/) I met them again and I saw they finally created the device. They called it [Fabman&trade;](https://fabman.io/).

The project consist in hardware devices and a SAAS platform in a Freemium mode. The thing is nice, don't get me wrong. But there is only one problem: It's not open source, not the hardware, not the software. It looks white but it's a shady black box. It gets even better: [Terms and conditions](https://fabman.io/terms) page, intellectual property section, paragraph 2:

## Fixing a wrong

My final project is creating an open source software and hardware version of the above project. To avoid getting into trademark issues I called it Labman.

### Project description

The hardware consists in a microcontroller (TBD) that has an input device (RFID reader module) and an output device (relay).

The software will consist in a relational database with users, courses and machines tables. There will be some basic interface and data visualization.

### Electronics

TBD

### Software

TBD
